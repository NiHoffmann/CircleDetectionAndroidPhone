# CircleDetectionAndroidPhone
Runs a home brew version for detection a red ball or any other object that is projected into a 2D filled red cricle (such as a red bottel cap) on an Android Phone.
Is able to any number of red Circles in an Image, but this was written for the Open Roberta Board developed by fraunhofer institut and make a Robot follow a Ball.
So only one Circle that is determined to be the Ball gets marked as the Ball.
